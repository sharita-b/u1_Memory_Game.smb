Game needs:

- 'click' event listeners to identify cards chosen
- for loop to run through the array of cards / .forEach method
- empty array variables to store flipped cards  -- Maybe more than one
- .random method to assign img to card back at beginning of gameplay
- Need to determine winning pairs

- an #id to define winning pairs celebration

- consider prompt to fill in data, () like Player name - asign this to a player variable

- turn option for multi player mode
<!-- - Use a Switch funtion to distinguish single play, or double play options. 

<!-- Case 1: (Single play) option will include timer count down

>> Case 2: (Two Player) option will show a card-match tally score --> --> Not doing this
